# Tymax

A simple app I built to stream TV channels online. No frills, just streaming.

## What is this?

Tymax is my personal project for streaming TV channels. Something straightforward to watch different channels without too much bloat.

## Features

- **Stream channels** - Watch TV directly on your phone
- **Browse categories** - Find channels by category (sports, news, etc.)
- **Filter by region** - See channels available in specific regions
- **Channel details** - View what's currently playing and basic info
- **Related content** - Discover similar channels while watching

## Disclaimer

Some of the streams available through this application may be illegal in some regions (Including mine). I'm no lawyer sooooo....
